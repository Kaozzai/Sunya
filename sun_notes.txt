ok now we need to make buttons great again. we probly want to be able to control auto repeat. just make buttons or
keys have a parameter to allow repeat. this is more convenient.... maybe not..
There is is this simple hardware detail i noticed. Many keyboards will easily send more than 1 symbol signal on input. We can easily
avoid this by asigning commands into combinations of keys. Once we input a combination, the system will consitently execute the
command once with no issues. And we can simply leave the fast command input thing when single keys are asigned a command.
It is not a really encouraged practice to call commands with a single key for a couple of reasons tho.
If you need to execute a commands many times fast, you will probably have a better result by creating a script for an orb to do it for you.
But i understand some users will expect to run a single line many times fast by leaving a single key pressed and so the system is
designed to handle that. We do want to explore multikeys further more but i dont expect mush since its more a hardware limitation.


#concept
We want visuals to reflect what happens with the datalines, we go a step backwards and more if we constrict instructions
to areas and visual conditions while it should be the other way around. data lines should dictate what can be done anytime to prevent
another specific instruction. All visual effects are contained and directed by
datalines... however.. we can take advantage of canvas features to provide information for use to work with forms positions.


#concept
A timeline... we should be able to see the timeline of instructions in a cue.

#concept
.. and yes we do need a drawing app.... but a really cool and simple one. not for 
drawing , but for connecting things with lines. I can picture this being a more handy feature for tocuhscreen users.


oscillators
Parameters of an oscillator are created just like any other beat. however osc works
a bit differently since audio needs to be more accurately responsive to time.
each tone line controls an oscillator. we can program tones to end by themselves or
we can change a tone parameter thats already playing directly
orb/osc/1/freq , orb/osc/1/gain , orb/osc/1/duration..
Or we can rewrite all tones by dumping a text
gain,1.2,freq,456,duration,5,...
gain,1.3,freq,234,duration,4,...
Tone lines need at least a few specific parameters to be audible. If no escential parameters
are given the tone wont be created?
setting osc/run to 'once' will call all lines at once and let them run its curse once.
'loop' will call all lines the same, but when the last tone finishes, all tone lines will
be called again and again indefinitely
'repeat' will call the same currently running tone line repeatedly.


#concept
In Sunya we dont have experience points. We just have experience.
We can see lots of numbers that will start to grow the more you learn stuff to cease
your anxiety levels, but its knowledge what will really strengthen you.
If you already know about videogames or have images or sound or text lines that could
help you represent your creations, Sunya
can recognize your images and ideas and use them to build a more accurate depiction
of your prescence.
This is why we dont call you 'User', for Sunya, and in the eyes of
Kaozzai, you are an 'entity' that comes from its own realm and brings with it its own
experience into the void sea. For this, Kaozzai is deeply honoured and grateful (but will not show it)


Third Act.
What really is evil?
Have i been missing out...?


#dialogue
Void King Pledge
I will write the instructions, i will execute the commands
Until all my words, become the lines your love demands
I will carry this memory in my black heart
with every step i take , and every beat inside
I will never forget this strange feeling
I promise to not let it fade, for i will follow its trace
The most beautiful feeling i once had..
The silence you so naturally float towards to is my infinity,
And i am (bound) in love with everything that exists in your prescence.

*an alien species has decided to yoink all game developers out of existance and so a bunch of NPCS are trying to make
players create games so they can work
"Sunya . A refreshing world building experience that pushes the boundaries between game developers and players!"
'But i just want to relax and have fun!'
Well, no more fun and relaxing! You will experience now the struggle of game developers!
Now You get your hands dirty because there are no game developers! And we need You to give us a purpuse! Please Help us!
We dont want to be deleted and forgotten for ever! We are Culture!


#intro
This link will take you to my github page which contains the program. Once you click, a ridiculously small html file will load
another ridiculously small JavaScript file which will take less than a second to load. Thats on your browser not me. 
After that you are free to disconnect from the Internet entirely and the program will run just fine.
But of course you dont NEED to do that, am just telling you so you know.
This program is contained in a couple of files that run on your browser just like any other web page you ve visited so far.
I know.. you still might believe i am trying to hack your computer so.. this
is my honest effort to make you see, it is not the case.
1. Why would i want to hack your computer when i got more important and fun stuff to do?
2. This program is a loveletter to all arts. Your computer was created with art. I respect art, thus, i respect your computer.
3. You Are Art. And i respect Art, so i respect You and your human vessel. And your cat or your dog if you have one.
4. Hacking people with malicious intent is a practice i would simply not ever be involved with because its not my style.
5. Github allowed my files so it having malicius content is very unlikely to be the case anyway.
6. If you are here, it means i am grateful that you decided to trust me and
taking the time for coming here and learn what this is all about. It means everything to me.
Why would i want to hack you or something after what you have done for me.. that would not make any sense.
7. This proyect is evolves out of Logic and Love.
And i apreciate your time as much as i apreciate mine. Time is all we have i think.
8. I would preffer to learn about you From You instead of going to the dark webz and buying some data sheet with all your
inclinations and deepest desires, i find that kinda creepy.

Ok hopefully, that should be enough!
This site has scripts to be used on Sunya to create things and can be studied as well while running in the program.
In Sunya, we can create texts with lines holding instructions to do things on the system, we call these 'scripts' in here.
There is a page with all commands available and other page with image files which can be used in the program as well.
I hope you dont find the system too complicated, i ve tried my best to keep it simple, consistent and powerful. This is not the final
version of course, and i would deeply apreciate any feedback you would like to give me or if you have an idea for an animation or
a videogame then please feel free to contact me on discord. 
I have some ideas to discuss regarding how this system might evolve once and if we get to form a group of friends.
ok have a nice day and take care of yourself. God bless :)


I believe knowledge and beauty should be freely shared and the internet should be a playground for people to learn how to relate
to each other and to respect each others ideas.
I think censorship is useless and despicable, i believe making the Internet a good place is a collective effort which cannot be
consolidated and
squared into a set of rules to follow. I think rules should be used to create fair games. Fair games are interesting.
Things can and will go wrong so building our own resilience and arguing for the sake of puting out
there what we think should be done in a given situation is a healthy practice. 



*allow sound?
Void background noise gently pressing in. Colors as well.
A giant circle coming towards the center clearing up the noise. 
Covering now the whole screen. Noise is gone.
A point in the middle. Its the user entity screen center.
We start inside another entity. This first encounter with another entity will
help user to understand some basic commands.

'Ok do you see no problem here? You can see the words just right?'
*user notices the interface is messed up
'Oh dear... we are gonna have to call someone.. what? developer is on vacation? Oh no we cant just interrupt his vacations for such
a minor mistake, these kinds of errors are perfectly understandable... he did code the whole game on his own after all he must be TIRED'
'You think you could fix this for me real quick? You just have to execute a little command on a terminal up here i cant do it myself
since i am just a Memory but you are an interdimentional entity so you should have that skill unlocked'
'just press Enter and type in...'
*and now the player learned something important. Everything in Sunya can be customized because all elements are within the reach
of the command line user just used. We gave the player a reason to learn the sinthax.

The idea of offering a story that fails narratively due to low budget or some comical reason has potential to be a fourth wall breaking
humour for a twist. the plot is indeed all prewritten but its interesting to involve the player on the experience of the developer
this is perfectly in line with the tematic. we want to reduce the gap between developers and players after all.

First dialogue (clean)
*Kaozzai begins to explains things

"Most Keys on your keyboard have no personal browser atachments. So we can work with those!
Try pressing all your favourite keys to check if they are ok! If you can see them on
the screen , it means we can asign commands to them...! But first let me show You
how to execute a command... ou you already know?
*press Enter
comline is now listenning. You can type in commands here!
*press Esc
And you can easily leave the command prompt with Esc any time in case your house is burning
... and you want to go check That out... which is not a bad idea...! 
*press Enter
Anyways.. let me tell you about
... a command to create a Memory Orb. Would you like to try to do that..? if so..
Just type in:
@MyFirstMemoryOrbInSunya ... Or you can call it whatever you want! You can call
it @Joni ! or @Jeni ! or @!!!  Just be sure to type
in this very fancy symbol from the 90's here  '@' I am not sure what even means..
But its very neat so i decided to include it in the program..!
*user creates orb
Nice! What a lovely name! *clears throat
A memory Orb is just a structure to hold instructions and data.
What kind of data will depend on its purpuse. To give orbs a purpuse, we need to
unseal specific aspects.
We can unseal aspects of this orb You just created... 

Text aspect
Lets open up the orb possibilities into a new aspect, text. Just type in the command:
unseal>>OrbName/text
!!!!! Great. Right now you have no feedback because we havent instructed orbs
to provide it.. But you have indeed created a text orb, i can smell it!
I Am The Feedback! ...
Now get in the Orb My lovely Guest!
*type in this instruction
#YourOrbName>>~/stance
An entity can take a stance by transfering an existing memory orb name into the ~/stance
box. The '~' symbol is a bit tricky to type in... but i like it so i included it in
the program!
*information about the ~ symbol
We can now request data to be printed in lines by our stanciated orb text!
Just type in *orbname
*user types in
And we can print information about You as an entity! Using the sguigly line alone!
~
You can also request access to your current stance with that money symbol which looks
like a fancy S, which stands for Stance!
$
Orbs with unsealed text aspect can hold all kinds of data for us!
We can even type in text lines right in, Just press Enter 2 times to
make inprompt listen. And type in some words as example. Then press Enter
again to create a text line, You can always just press Esc if you want to close 
a prompt without creating an Entry.
*types into inprompt
And there is your text line...
Try adding a few other lines so you see how they pile up after the other!
*types some more lines
I will now give you a few shortcuts and set up a couple of orbs running Scripts
to help you catch the drift of what is happening in your screen..if i may..

*Kaozzai creates some orbs and set them in motion
*user can now :
use arrows to move ent screen around
use wasd to move selected orb around
use zz and mm to select orbs(change stance and follow it with the screen)
use nn and bb to move between lines(followed by screen user)
And we can see a text with the entity stats reflecting all these actions
in real time, and following the screen around at a fixated position

Try moving around a bit with Arrows on your Keyboard so we can create another orb
to play around with.. dont go too far!

*user moves around and explores some experiments visible here and there


Purpuse
Sunya does not aim to imitate the inner mechanics of the natural world in order
to produce a realistic result, Sunya  s purpuse is to become the tool by which the
imagination can easily express itself with no restraints nor dificulties.
We want to be able to paint the image and put together the sounds that only can be
contemplated and experienced without
the neccesities of the natural to be fulfilled. Its an exploration of the imagination
in an abundant computer canvas, a semiotic square for x and y coordinates forming a 
continuous grid, a well designed, instinctive tool for everybody, a chance to learn
trough rythm and trough building up logic structures to encapsulate possible events.
Sunya celebrates both the possibilities and the limitations of the cyber reality.

The purpose Kaozzai had in mind when he built the system was not to take full advantage of the machine power, but to allow
the user to have full understanding of what the system is doing under the hood. Sunya is designed to teach users how does
programming work, and how we can use the computer to build our own rules, and to create our own games. That this possibility
already exist, and that it will not take all your time, and that you will benefit inmensely from being able to do this!

You can now move around this text. Feels quite snappy doesnt it? We do not create nor
manipulate html elements to do so, except for the canvas element and the Web Audio API,
both highly optimized systems on which the whole Sunya data structure relies on, there are really few other html elements around
we are using.
So the system is very responsive and also fully customizable.

Script Aspect
Every orb is independent, but we can build the strings to link its actions in 
any desired sequence using Sunya script sinthax.
All the commands you are able to type in and execute in the comprompt can also be written in a sequence of lines
to be stored on an orb container. orbname/script. Now this orb will execute those lines whenever it is instructed to do so.
This line will store the word 'once' into the orb script run key, and so the orb will execute its script once.
#once>>orbname/script/run . 
This is the second Aspect. script.
To unseal the script aspect we run :
unseal>>orbname/script

*user might be overwhelmed already

*user doubts
'Ok but were is my character? What is this? It doesnt feel like a game. Do i have
to learn so much?
You might be wondering...
I am only teaching you how to create new memories, because..
Your character? i dont have it. I didnt include it in the program.
*crickets

*we got a fast learner

In Sunya , we can build our creations feedback from scratch...
Right now if you want to learn what else you can do here, there is a command list
you can check in the site.. Going forward, Kaozzai aims to create a Narrative to
facilitate the asimilation of the commands offered by the system. Hopefully his
friends might help him puting togheter a 'Story Mode' or a 'Tutorial' as it might be
reffered to.
So stay tunned!


Chapter 1
At some point... i learned that in order to move forward, i would have to take in
every piece of new information, and check how would this new knowledge fit into
my current view. To help others, i had to help myself.

It was a hard task.. There was no clear path. All anchors seemed to
fade out too soon for me to find peace, to take root in my own understanding of
the reality that unfolded faster and faster before my eyes.. my ears.. my heart..

It was a constant existential crisis. No one could tell what was is it all about.
There was no guiding light to hold on to.
And there was no one to truly share what i was living trough,
the way i wanted to share it.

And so i became lonely. My own desire of knowledge to help others, set me apart from
others.
I layed down all my cards in the floor, closed my eyes.. and hoped not to fade
as well..

The truth had to be simple, natural. It wont come in a box, it wont
come from a master, or an idol, or a job, or money, or a piece of art.

Truth is a state of the mind, a dance between the vectors in the spotlight,
a pursuing of the conciousness, a supreme instinct untainted by fear,
a feeling that blooms even when  vaguely described by the least concerned..

I found the words, i found the Logic, and i could check for consistency.
I could see the future. I understood what i had to learn, what i had to do
in order to open up for the right events to take place. The good ending.

But i wasnt ready to become stronger.
My mind was unstable again. . The mistakes in my youth left a toll in my spirit.
I would find a path forward from time to time.. and sit on it.. only to feel the tears
coming out.. only to be washed away by the overwhelmed sea of sadness, pouring out
from my spine. Rusting all the joints of my graceful thoughts, and blurring my sight,
pululating my mind with ghosts, and terrible forms snaping from the darkness of
the black hole inside my heart.

I was disapointed of my own selfish acts after all.
I could not hold accountable for the things i lost in the way, for the friends i left behind.. for the love i didnt give back.
And i was alone again.

(not)Waiting for the dawn to come.

There was after all, a series of logical steps to follow.
A clear and methodic process to enlightnment. The vessel of freedom had to be constructed.
From the inside out, and outside going inwards as well. The path forward.

It only took a bit more.. it only took for me to heal my body
and clear my mind to keep building it.. And i would only become stronger
by sharing my insights with... friends. The friends i lost in the way..

*help Kaozzai meet his friends

I feel blessed now. Am not so sure as to 'how to call it'..., 	but is this flow state of
kinda intuitively finding the answer to a problem
Just by 	keep trying to simplify things...
Take distance and see other possible ways to solve a problem.
			It feels absolutely envigorating,
it feels like flying.

In this realm of electric harmony . I cannot harm my friends with my mistakes. 
I want the flow state. 		I dont want to loose myself in errors. I dont want you 	
to drown in the sea of my failure.
Take distance.	A door will open.

*Kaozzai opens up what seem to be a gate to the online world.


!!!!!!!!!!
after that... we probably need to modularize the whole entity structure.... !!!!!!!!
OK so ents could be reffered by name just like orbs.. but how far can we send commands to other entities... can we even do that
We need to know an entity name.. we should be able to simply ask the void for an entity name... shoould other entities be even visible..
How about we can only work with other entities orbs memories.. that kinda makes sense... a lot of sense actually..
But say another user ask for a user data, and start controling the user screen.. how to prevent that. Say an orb in the wild could send
commands to affect entity params.. orbs should be able to send command signal to an entity structure...
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lets just asume user is the only entity for now, lets worry about multiple entities when we go Online Sunya.. ok? ok . solved.
resolved!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!




experiment
all my rizz in a single image lol


experiment
Peak Combat
OK so. a vision. Two entities find each other. As long as all their memories are
in guard, entities cannot control each others
memories, but since all memories are busy preventing signals from the other entity,
no further action can be taken without leting the guard down.. 
An entity might now trigger a crack on the defense of one Character, and watch in real
time all scripts trigering to secure control of its oponent. Only when the
user is familiar enough with the script sinthax , and is able to read how scripted events unfold,
massive knowledge of Combat and its rules can be adquired by triggering and studying this combat sequence.


experiment
puzzles
I just got an idea. How about rects . Rectangles are good. The screen is a
rectangle. A rect area that makes all orbs push into a specific direction always as
long as orbs are inside the rect area.
Instead of testing the rect orb against all orbs, we test displacing orbs against
rect. 


experiment
A condition to force entity always follow one of its orbs at least. so no independant
entity screen movility. Also orbs speed is limited... and we cant create orbs, only find them. This is basically a game engine..
or at the very least this seems to be the way to it


experiment
Editor Scripts
a script to remove all orbs on a specific text
a script to show all orbs always , follows entity around, darkened when not selected,
highlight selected line and actually make
orb in line become the stance and move the entity screen to center of selected orb.
we can then just select a line to change stance
a script to show entity stats always
a script to show stance stats always


experiment
a script to create an orb with random instructions running. this might be fun


experiment
Ok i think i figured out combat.
We want to be able to create rules when entities are inside other entities orbs.
We can choose to use the rules to play... This solves everything
2 entities can enter a common third entity which is applying the rules. So now
when the two entity guests try do to overpowered commands, the third entity
englobing prevents those actions.
This is fine.


experiment
slow breathing, slow filtering, slow is faster!!!




make chatOn and nLine a thing .. should be Cline Iline . done
aaand we probly want to be able to situate rectangle forms using the screen percentage... that could be handy to create proper
interfaces. not crucial tho. done
ou. i think we can totally forget about angles right now. deep inside i believe we can have a lot of fun already. you need to let go fam

.. and then... make some image editor scripts.. but first define the image center mechanic. done
remember we said image and sound aspects need special coordinate paramaters to have point of origin . yes done its cx and cy, they act on
drawAll directly. its done 

. maybe some sound editing
scripts to play around with oscillators... and by then we should start working
on Kaozzai and game introduction..... omg so much work

We want to be able to produce text and wait for user input to keep on with the main story script. we should be able to do that
already.. .. am guessing the more straightforward way to do this is write instructions to wait for a specific value.
So maybe output signals could produce a text with the value of the command , and maybe the value of the target, on two separate lines..
MAYBe we can even include this in the sinthax. orb/out/instruction , orb/out/target . In this way, we can trully annalyze the effect
of any instruction executed by an orb. . . we could say :
orb/out/target>>aorb/text/1<>#once>>listener/script/run   or
orb/out/instruction>>aorb/text/5<>#once>>listener2/script/run
We would now have picked the value with which we want to work with and store it on aorb.
listener could now use a target or a command to create an effect related.
aorb/text/1>>~/stance  ,  aorb/text/5 .. 
hmm.... how would we copy a modification of a parameter and redirect that same change into another orb Aspect, this is what we want..!
orb/out/echo>>newtarget    or     orb/out>>orb/text/1 
out alone returns the instruction. we can then say   orb/out==#+20>>Orb/circle/3/
So echo copies the command but replaces the target and casts it inmediately. ...
but what if we just set a script to do this : orb1/circle/x>>orb2/circle/x and just run on repeat. this is how we make an orb follow
another orb. so instead of focusing on hearing outputs and do stuff with the literal output string, we just use output to check
for the type of command that the listening orb executed? because maybe we dont want to copy the circle position at everyhearbeat
but only when a specific output comes from the target orb... output is a one beat event.. we need to think differently , we need to
take advantage on this particularity instead of taking the boar aproach.



ok now we need to create interactions. so the most convenient way would be by annalyzing o.o . orb output.
+100>>o1/circle/1/x .. this instruction needs to generate an output on the caster that can be annalyzed by a listener instruction
if casted on the same heartbeat , o1/out>>listener/text . the result needs to be expressed in a multiliner.
If an aspect changes location, output should express the new location, what signal got it there, and what orb. We check the state of the
aspect that concerns us, not the beat itself. 
A listener orb needs to be able to use the output data to produce an instruction to
copy its behavior and execute on a different target,
cancel its effect, effectively blocking the effect of the instruction or
modify the instruction using a different text line and proyect it somewhere else as the listener see fit.
Once this mechanisms are ready we wont need drag. Orbs will have an efective medium to comunicate and create timed dynamics.
MSp dont ring many bells now either
.. and its done. output signal works fine.


and now am thinking maybe we can also turn the key memory system into a job performed by an orb... since we can also asign
spacebar commands... wait. nah we good for now

We want rectangle aspect to perform the job of html tag containers for text on the screen to provide highlights into elements
poping out in the screen. Rectangles will also be able to tell if there is a specified memory aspect in its area probably.
A command to ask if target is on area

So am thinking its 3 acts really. early game, mid game and late game
