scripts to edit animations using an image file from local machine.
The Main editor script needs to run from the orb that holds the image already. 
We use mirrors to proyect image orb and rect orb. 1 img mirror proyects the full image on x0 y0 .
A second rect mirror is used to select the part of the image we want to extract and use.
This rect selection is in synch with the image orb selected beat. So the original image proyected is in synch with the rect
mirror selection position and size. We move the image with arrows, and we move the mirror rect with WASD.
The orb image beat is running on repeat.

Entity log
Create an orb Elog to follow entity around showing entity stats
making orbs with only script aspect to run a single listener should be a thing. This script creates Elog to print entity stats
and ElogPos to make Elog always stay on the corner screen of the user. We also want OrbsSel. an orb to always print the current orbs
created by the entity.
ok now we want to be able to highlight the selected orb and print its status to follow around user. If no orb selected then we just
see Elog and OrbsSel. to do this, create a mirror on every beat using the current line of OrbsSel
and then, we asign mm and zz skeys to commands to change currently selected line on OrbsSel


We also want a button to simply toggle on and off all text on the screen. maybe a script #once>>SealAllText/script/run .. does this
Goes trough a list and runs an instruction using data on the list once. how to do that. now we can do it because now signals have
a different sinthax
problem now is... am sealing the text of the orb that contains the names of targets to seal so it stops in the middle of it lol
ou man this is hella tricky

how about a map to see where the entity is in a specific number of pixels on the canvas. This is just a pair of rectangles. should not be
hard to put together... however it should work within a limited area in the canvas.


Print entity stats on the left corner and follow around the entity. 2 orbs. Dump script on stance orb and then run.

Prints all orbs names created and highlights the currently selected one. Also follows around the entity. 3 orbs.

skeys sets
We want sets of skeys to be easily configured by simply dumping lines into the comprompt. So a script when run can configure all skeys
at once. A set to edit images, a set to explore, a set to play around with oscillators etc

Turn arrows into displacement keys to move around the entity screen by 100 pixels when pressed. no orb required

Create many orbs at once to mess around with using Main. run Main script once
.. what if we want to creat acircel with initial values kinda randombly at a certain area.. we can always just ask for a value
put it on a text somewhere and then use that value to modify an aspect directly o1/text/1>>o2/circle/1/r .... stil not a solution
we want to use 2 values form a text and create a random range how would we do that
